Search Challenge Programming
============================
In this exam, you are provided with hotels database in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. 

We need you to implement a REST service to perform queries to a search engine where the data must be indexed. Create a simple ajax page to call the API. More details about each component are described bellow. You may use any language or platform that you like: C#, Java, Scala, Go, etc.

Good luck!


Search engine
======
  1. Use Elasticsearch, Solr or Lucene
  2. Sort results by relevance score

API
======
  1. Provide an endpoint to perform queries

Web page
======
  1. Search as you type (provide ajax function to search hotels while typing)

Provide all source code and instructions to run your application. Provide a quick explanation about the chosen relevance function strategy.
